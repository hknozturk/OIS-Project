## How to set up environments

- First install necessary node modules. Run `npm install` in OIS-Project and OIS-Project/backend.
- Be sure that your mysql server up & running
- Check OIS-Project/backend/server.js file. Be sure that mysql parameters are correct (dbname, password, ...)
- To run the node server `node server.js` while you are in backend. Our server runs on localhost 8000 port. If you want you can change the port.
- To run Angular front-end check below.
- Be sure that backend and frontend running in different console.

# Ontologies

You can find ontologies we use in our application `ontologies` folder. We use Jena-Fuseki and Jetty server to query ontologies. Check `jetty` folder and read.me file for more info.

# Jena-Fuseki

To run Jena-Fuseki, go to Jena-Fuseki folder you installed and execute `./fuseki-server --update --mem /{YOUR-SERVER_NAME}`.
